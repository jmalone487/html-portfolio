<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is James Malone. I was born and raised in St. Louis, and family is a huge part of my life. I have two amazing kids, an older daughter and a younger son who keep me motivated every day. We also have two adorable Shih Tzu dogs, a boy and a girl, who are full of energy and love.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I'm passionate about sports, especially basketball and boxing, and I love staying active through exercise. When I'm not working out or watching a game, you can usually find me playing video games and unwinding.</p>

<p>Professionally, I'm passionate about information systems and enjoy learning about technology and how it impacts the world. I also love exploring new technologies and challenging myself with new projects. I'm currently expanding my skills in web development and excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
